"09.27.24_volt_testing": On 09.27.2024, we decided to test both the breadboard IMU and the CubeSat IMU, by giving the magnetorquer on each a constant PWM, and changing the voltage given to the Teensy to see how that altered the IMU readings from the magnetometer of the magnetorquer. The "volttesting ..." files are from the breadboard. The columns are as follows: PWM, mag_x, mag_y, mag_z, mag_x_offset, mag_y_offset, mag_z_offset, voltage. The "voltcubesat_testing ..." are from the CubeSat. Note that this data was recorded from serial printing it into VSCode. The values from this are a bit mixed up, they were Serial printed in 3's, the mag_y value, the mag_y offset, and the voltage value. So every third value is of the same category. The values that range from 3.6-4.2 are the voltage value, the values closer to 60-70 is the mag_y, and the other is the offset. Note that for the numbering of the CubeSat, the tests are slightly different, shown below: 
•	1-2: constant PWM, changing the voltage
•	3: constant PWM, kept the voltage constant
•	4: no PWM, changing the voltage


"airbearingrig_tests" these were the tests on the airbearing rig, refer to the excel sheet within the folder for the extended description for every test. The footage for each test can also be found in the same folder.

"original_volt_imu_dataset". Iterating through all of the PWM from -255 to 255, at certain voltages, reading the magnetometer readings that it is receiving from the magnetorquer. The naming of each of the data files only differ with the number, "3.9v", "4.1v", and "5.0v" for example. These represent the voltage that we gave the breadboard for that respective test. The columns within each file are as follow from left to right: PWM, mag_x, mag_y, mag_z, x_offset, y_offset, z_offset, voltage. Note that there are two extra files with the word "bad" in their name, these were found to be outliers compared to the rest.

"10.03.2024_voltimu_dataset". Like "original_volt_imu_dataset", iterating through all PWM's and finding magnetometer values. Same format as before.

"10.04.2024_voltimu_dataset" The third time in which I used the same code, of iterating the PWM on the breadboard from -255 to 255 and reading the IMU values to see if they differ. This differs from the previous two times this was done, data found in "10.03.2024_voltimu_dataset" and "original_volt_imu_dataset". Same format as before. There is one file named "bread_voltimu_4.0v_slow", which was where instead of iterating quickly through every PWM between -255 and 255 PWM, I did every 10 integers, and did it more slowly. Found that there wasn't a big difference in the IMU values when doing this. 

"23sep2024_olddata_onflippersdcard" Basically useless folder. The SD card had a lot of files that built up over time that I cleared out on 09.23.2024, most of these should already have a copy in another folder, but just in case I didn't copy one, the original copies from the SD card are here. 

"10.09.2024_voltimu_dataset" A new set of tests on the CubeSat and the breadboard. Focusing on the CubeSat data, whereas all previous CubeSat testing was constant PWM and varying voltage, now we are doing varying PWM and keep voltage constant. Naming is self explanatory "cubesat_voltimu_(voltage)v" where (voltage) is the voltage we gave it for the test. There is another "cubesat_voltimu_testing5" that is at 3.6 V and only recorded the y_magnetometer value. Can ignore this one it was just a first preliminary test. There is also a "cubesat_voltimu_3.6v_outlier" which had some weirdly high data and I redid the test to make ""cubesat_voltimu_3.6v". Now in terms of the Breadboard Data, they are named like the ones in the previous folders, like "10.04.2024_voltimu_dataset". Also note that all of these, both the CubeSat and Breadboard, are all now iterating through every 10 PWM and a longer delay in each loop. No particular difference that we saw between this and doing every 1 PWM, just a longer delay might allow for less error on the part of the IMU.

"10.10.2024_voltimu_dataset" Another dataset, going from 3.6-4.2V, interating from -255 to 255 PWM on the magnetorquer and measuring IMU values. On the CubeSat system. "cubesat_voltimu_3.6v_firsthalf" is because when this data was collected, it looks like two datasets were overwritten in 3.6v, "firsthalf" is the first set of data collected, and the second half is stored in "cubesat_voltimu_3.6v"

"10.17.2024_voltimu_dataset" Another dataset for both the breadboard and the cubesat. This time, the breadboard was tested to work with the new softiron method (of getting softiron values for a range of voltages rather than just using one set of softiron values for all offsets). The cubesat dataset was unused, further testing needed as there seems to be a big jump in the IMU readings for any voltage used. This doesn't change when the PWM values were ran in reverse (shown by the files with "reverse" in their name.

"10.21.2024_voltimu_dataset". A full dataset for the cubesat with the IMU jump fixed compared to previous tests. A second delay was added between the IMU initialization and start of the loop


"10.22.2024_voltimu_dataset". Another full dataset for the cubesat with another thing fixed. There are a couple of things in the cubesat, including the radio emitter, that take up a lot of power and they need to be turned off first. So the necessary pins were set to low and there is a 60 second wait before starting the loop. There are two files with the word "prev", basically they are much lower in IMU values compared to the other files and I don't know why. They were the first two files to be made as well.

"10.23.2024_voltimu_dataset" Another full dataset for the cubesat, same as "10.22.2024_voltimu_dataset". Using a different power source this time because other power source is being used on the air bearing rig. Going to make sure voltage given to the Teensy are exact using a multmeter (as the power source only goes to one decimal point). The "prev" is with the same purpose as "10.22.2024_voltimu_dataset".

"10.24.2024_voltimu_dataset" Another full dataset for cubesat. Using the same power source as "10.23.2024_voltimu_dataset" and verifying voltage precision with a multmeter.
